# Algorithms-DSA

This repository contains all essential algorithms implemented in Java. It is designed to help increase understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms from my side, and to assist students and anyone interested in learning algorithms. The collection covers topics such as sorting, searching, recursion, backtracking, and more, with clear and practical code examples for each concept.

Feel free to explore the folders and files to deepen your knowledge, improve your problem-solving skills, and support your learning journey in computer science and programming.

## Why This Repository?

Learning algorithms is a key step in mastering computer science and technical interviews. This repository is created to make it easier for students and self-learners to access well-organized, practical examples of important algorithms. Each file is written with clarity and simplicity in mind, so you can focus on understanding the logic and implementation.

## What You'll Find

- Classic sorting and searching algorithms
- Recursion and backtracking techniques
- Cycle sort, sliding window, and comparator examples
- Solutions to common algorithmic problems

## How to Use

Browse the folders by topic, open the Java files, and study the code. Try running and modifying the algorithms to see how they work. This hands-on approach will help reinforce your understanding and prepare you for exams or coding interviews.

## Contributions
